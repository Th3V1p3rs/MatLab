All about Matlab coding and simulink modelling

Help me with the problem.

.mat files are as follows:

i_app = applied current during the test
V_app = measured voltage during the test
V = simulated voltage from simulink model
T = time vector

phis_neg & phis pos = solid phase concentration over the time (to estimate parameters, we need to give this as an input)
sigma_neg  & sigma_pos = solid phase conductivity, <-- this we want to estimate on comparing measured voltage vs simulated voltage results

%% Upload your steps by screenshot or explain how do you use parameter estimator tool in simulink
